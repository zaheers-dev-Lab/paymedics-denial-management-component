<h2>💡 Why Use This Implementation?</h2>
While many accordions rely on heavy libraries, this version is built for speed and search engine visibility:
<ol>
  <li><b>SEO Structural Integrity:</b> Ensures that content hidden within the accordion remains indexable by search engine crawlers, which is vital for long-form service pages.</li>
  <li><b>Accessibility (A11Y):</b> Built with ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls) to ensure screen readers can navigate the data easily.</li>
  <li><b>Performance:</b> Zero external dependencies. No jQuery or heavy frameworks—just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS for near-instant load times.</li>
  <li><b>User Experience:</b> Smooth 400ms transitions for a premium, professional feel suitable for healthcare and corporate environments.</li>
</ol>
